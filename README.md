# 🌿 dotfiles — i3wm Rice Setup with ZSH, Polybar, Dunst, and Animations

This is my personal rice for a soothing, aesthetic, and minimal Linux desktop using **i3wm**, **picom-jonaburg**, **polybar**, **dunst**, and **zsh**.

Built with love, rounded corners, blur, sliders, and keybinds that make sense ✨
